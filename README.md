2. Installing the datapack
3. Setting up the commands
4. Running

  ***Requirements***
1. Datapack was made for Minecraft Version 1.20.2 (If you know what your doing you could try changing the pack.mcmeta file)
2. Minecraft Java edition
3. And a device that can handle lots of particles (Recommend a PC though my laptop could handle it sort of...)

  ***Installing the datapack***
1. Go to your ".minecraft" directory (Type %appdata% into your file explorer's search bar)
2. Go into your "saves" folder
3. Then choose the world you would like to contain the datapack. And click on that folder
4. Move into the "datapacks" folder
5. And finally paste/git clone/unzip the rickrollDatapack into the folder


  ***Setting up the commands***
1. Type the following commands into chat:
   > /gamerule commandBlockOutput true
   > /give @s minecraft:repeating_command_block
   > /reload
2. Then you should see the loaded message "Datapack loaded!" in green
3. Afterwards place the repeating command block down and type the following command:
   > function code:rickroll
4. Then close the command block and place a lever/powersource next to the repeating command block

  ***Running***
1. Now all you have to do is flick the lever to on. And watch as rick astley appears on your screen
